Project Description: Employee Management System with Authentication, RBAC,
and Messaging
Project Objective
Develop a robust backend application using ASP.NET MVC to implement an Employee Management
System. The project will include core backend functionalities such as user authentication, role-based
access control (RBAC), email confirmation, password recovery, and real-time messaging between
employees. The application must be deployed and a shareable link provided to demonstrate its
functionality.
Key Features and Requirements
1. User Registration and Authentication
○ Implement user registration with fields for email, password, and role selection (e.g.,
Admin, Manager, Employee).
○ Send a confirmation email to new users with a verification link to activate their
accounts.
○ Enable user login with email and password.
○ Implement "Forgot Password" functionality:
■ Users can request a password reset link via email.
■ Provide a secure mechanism for resetting the password.
2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
○ Assign roles to users during registration or by an admin.
○ Admin Role:
■ Full control over user and employee management.
○ Manager Role:
■ View employees and send/receive messages.
○ Employee Role:
■ Limited access, including viewing their own details and messaging colleagues.
3. Employee Management
○ CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employee records.
○ Include employee-specific fields like:
■ Name
■ Department
■ Position
■ Salary
4. Messaging System
○ Allow employees to send real-time messages to one another within the application.
○ Provide a simple interface for selecting a recipient and viewing conversation history.
○ Notifications for new messages.
5. Deployment
○ Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Azure or AWS).
○ Provide a shareable link to the deployed application for review and testing.
Expected Deliverables
● A fully functional ASP.NET MVC application with all required features.
● End-to-end authentication workflow, including registration, email confirmation, login, and
password reset.
● Role-based access control for secured operations and data.
● A messaging system enabling real-time communication between users.
● A deployed application link to test all features.
